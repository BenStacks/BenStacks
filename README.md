👋 Hi, I’m **Bennett Uchechukwu** 

👀 I’m interested in web development, especially the exciting world of Web3 and blockchain technology. I'm passionate about building decentralized applications (dApps) and exploring how blockchain can transform various industries.

🌱 I’m currently learning React, Nodejs and clarity smart contract language to build a solid foundation in web development. I'm also diving into clarity and solidity to understand smart contracts and how to interact with bitcoin, stx, and Ethereum.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to Web3, whether it's building a dApp, contributing to open-source projects, or exploring new blockchain technologies together!

📫 How to reach me: You can connect with  via email  at bennet.btc.stacks@gmail.com.

😄 Pronouns: He/Him

⚡ Fun fact: I love gaming and often draw inspiration from game mechanics when designing web experiences. I'm UI design a lot!
